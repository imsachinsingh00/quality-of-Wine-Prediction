# Wine Quality Prediction

This project predicts wine quality using a supervised machine learning model trained on physicochemical test data.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the model.
- `wine_quality.csv`: Dataset of wine samples with chemical attributes.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🍷 Dataset Features

Includes attributes like:
- Fixed Acidity
- Volatile Acidity
- Citric Acid
- Residual Sugar
- Chlorides
- Free Sulfur Dioxide
- Total Sulfur Dioxide
- Density
- pH, Sulphates, Alcohol
- Quality (target)

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure `wine_quality.csv` is in the working directory.
2. Launch and run `Wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`.
3. Model is trained and evaluated in the notebook.
